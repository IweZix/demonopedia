# Demonopedia

DÃ©onopedia is an exciting project aimed at bringing together all the characters from the anime **Demon Slayer** on one website. Here, you will find detailed information about the characters, their appearances, and their roles in the anime. This site was created with the goal of learning and mastering a new technology: Vue.js.

## Why this project?

I wanted to create a place where fans can find detailed information about their favorite characters. This project also allowed me to dive into Vue.js, a technology I have wanted to learn for some time. Working on this site has allowed me to combine my passion for anime with my desire to acquire new web development skills.

## Why vue.js?

Because I wanted to learn a new technology, and Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework that is easy to learn and use. Vue.js is also known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for building interactive web applications.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
