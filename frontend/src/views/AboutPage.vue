    <h1>About Demonopedia</h1>
    <p>
      DÃ©onopedia is an exciting project aimed at bringing together all the characters from the anime
      <strong>Demon Slayer</strong> on one website. Here, you will find detailed information about
      the characters, their appearances, and their roles in the anime. This site was created with
      the goal of learning and mastering a new technology: Vue.js.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
    <p>
      As a fan of <strong>Demon Slayer</strong>, I wanted to create a place where fans can find
      detailed information about their favorite characters. This project also allowed me to dive
      into Vue.js, a technology I have wanted to learn for some time. Working on this site has
      allowed me to combine my passion for anime with my desire to acquire new web development
      skills.
    </p>
    <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>
    <p>
      Several Easter eggs are hidden throughout the site. Can you find them? ðŸ˜‰ <br />
      (The GitHub repo is available if you need any hints)
